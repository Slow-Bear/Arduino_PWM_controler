# Arduino_PWM_controler
A simple PWM controler 

Why? 
Because you may never know when you may need a PWM controler on the fly
This will work with most Arduino (Please donate to Arduino project!) boards and Arduino colnes.
The frequency is a 1 time set during the set-up process.
The duty cycle is variable even while "working"
